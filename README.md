## About Me

Iâ€™m Dr. Boris Levant, an algorithms researcher, R&D manager, and senior lecturer passionate about the intersection of AI, education, and real-world applications.

With over 15 years of experience spanning semiconductors, computer vision, deep learning, and optimization, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building and leading algorithmic teams, driving innovative solutions from concept to production, and shaping GenAI adoption in industry.

Alongside my industry work, I teach and mentor students in algorithms, AI, machine learning, and computer vision, bridging theory with hands-on practice. My mission is to make advanced technologies not only cutting-edge but also accessible and impactful in everyday life.

ðŸ”¹ Research â†’ Application: Translating mathematical rigor into working solutions.

ðŸ”¹ Industry â†’ Academia: Building bridges between innovation and education.

ðŸ”¹ AI â†’ Peopleâ€™s Lives: Harnessing technology to solve practical, human-centered challenges.

If youâ€™re interested in AI for semiconductors, education, or applied machine learning, youâ€™ll find projects here that reflect both my professional journey and personal curiosity.

## Teaching

I enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others learn. Here are some of my courses I teach in the Ashkelon Colledge

- <a href="https://github.com/borislevant/algorithms">Algorithms</a> - Algorithms course introducing fundamental algorithmic techniques and essential graph algorithms. Core topics include greedy methods, divide-and-conquer strategies, and dynamic programming. In addition, the course covers the foundations of graph theory and algorithms, such as breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), shortest paths (Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford), and minimum spanning trees (Kruskal and Prim). Together, these topics provide students with a solid understanding of classical algorithm design and analysis
- <a href="https://github.com/borislevant/algorithms">Algorithms-2</a> - Advanced topics in Algorithms
- <a href="https://github.com/borislevant/python4ml">Python for Machine Learning</a> - A collection of Python-based Jupyter notebooks designed to support my Machine Learning courses at various colleges. The notebooks cover a broad range of topics â€” starting from the fundamentals of NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas, and progressing through core concepts of regression, classification, and essential machine learning principles

## Projects

Here are some projects I've been working on:

### [Youtube Transcriber]
