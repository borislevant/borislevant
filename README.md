## About Me

Iâ€™m Dr. Boris Levant, an algorithms researcher, R&D manager, and senior lecturer passionate about the intersection of AI, education, and real-world applications.

With over 15 years of experience spanning semiconductors, computer vision, deep learning, and optimization, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of building and leading algorithmic teams, driving innovative solutions from concept to production, and shaping GenAI adoption in industry.

Alongside my industry work, I teach and mentor students in algorithms, AI, machine learning, and computer vision, bridging theory with hands-on practice. My mission is to make advanced technologies not only cutting-edge but also accessible and impactful in everyday life.

ðŸ”¹ Research â†’ Application: Translating mathematical rigor into working solutions.
ðŸ”¹ Industry â†’ Academia: Building bridges between innovation and education.
ðŸ”¹ AI â†’ Peopleâ€™s Lives: Harnessing technology to solve practical, human-centered challenges.

If youâ€™re interested in AI for semiconductors, education, or applied machine learning, youâ€™ll find projects here that reflect both my professional journey and personal curiosity.
